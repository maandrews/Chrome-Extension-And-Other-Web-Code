Chrome Extension:  

The like / dislike ratio bar at the bottom of every YouTube video is a great way to tell what people think of the video's content.  However, you can't actually see this information until you click to watch the video itself.  This is where my Chrome extension comes in.  It provides the user with the ability to see the like/dislike ratio of a video before ever clicking on it.  The extension uses a graphic identical to the one YouTube uses on the video's page, and it appears next to or below a video's thumbnail depending on the part of YouTube the user is on.  This extension brings a nice improvement to the quality of life for YouTube users.  Two screenshots are available among the files for this project.
